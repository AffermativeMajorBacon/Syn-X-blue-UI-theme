# Syn-X-blue-UI-theme
Hi, this is made by Jawdat#4992, nobody else ofcourse, but I would like you to acknowledge that you have to have the REAL synapse x and be logged in for this to work, otherwise, it will just prompt you to log in constantly and you can't do anything unless you have a whitelisted login.
If you would like to check me out on roblox, my username is; OfermativeMajorBacon  (Ik it's spelled wrong just shut up)
and yeah that's pretty much it
Do NOT use this as your own, becuase if you post it somewhere, I'll find it and have it taken down, thanks!


Thank you for downloading Synapse X Blue UI.
